# LG G8 Mini Guide
## Introduction \*and mini rant\*
So, you might've bought this phone because it's supposedly still a great phone in 2022 or thinking it's the cheapest option for getting your hands on Snapdragon 855? Well, after reading this section, you might want to reevaluate your life decision from now on.

Compared to other Snapdragon 855 phones. It falls flat on many aspects like almost dead software updates, having one of the worst community support, mediocre screen nowadays \*mine has horrible purple smear\* and **trash tier soc binning.**

And the best part about it? There's LG V50, which is in every way an **upgrade** over LG G8, **FOR THE EXACT SAME PRICE!**.

Well then, is there any way we can improve it?&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yes, we can!, **and I'll show you how!**^^
## Stock Rom or Custom Rom?
Here's a short breakdown between the two.

>**Stock Rom:** The bread and butter, locked down recent button \*will comes up later\*, heavy and unoptimized ui, no manual Quad Dac mode switching \*very much needed for good audio gear\* but other than that pretty solid after tweaking and is A11

>**Custom Rom:** Have everything the former doesn't have, is much lighter but in the current state for LG G8, the most stable rom as of writing is Arrow OS A12L and current development is very lackluster.

\*Note: imo A11>A12 in Performance, Battery and Stability\*

Now that you've decided let's get to work!.
